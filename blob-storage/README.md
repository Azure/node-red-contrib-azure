# node-red-contrib-azure-blob-storage

node-red-contrib-azure-blob-storage is a <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node that allows you to work with Azure Blob Storage. You can create and delete Containers and also blob files.


It contains two Node-RED cloud nodes: **Azure Save Blob Storage** and **Azure Get Bob Storage**

#### Azure Blob Storage

Node-Red node to connect to Azure Blob Storage


Ex: 'msg.payload' -> filename that you need to upload. Ex: filename.txt

- Use `msg.payload` to send a file to save on Azure Blob Storage.

- This file must be in the same folder of Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`


## Installation

```
npm install -g node-red-contrib-azure-blob-storage


## How to Use



### Node-RED Setup
Follow the instructions [here](http://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/installation) to get Node-RED setup locally.

```

### Saving data into Azure Blob Storage

1. Open Node-RED, usually: <http://127.0.0.1:1880>

2. Go to Hamburger Menu -> Import -> Clipboard

    ```
    [{"id":"ead7871a.8172c8","type":"inject","z":"5e92f737.c60d68","name":"Payload","topic":"","payload":"DocumentTest.txt","payloadType":"str","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"x":436,"y":273,"wires":[["b0dbc35f.28665"]]},{"id":"fdab4f1f.0cab","type":"debug","z":"5e92f737.c60d68","name":"Log","active":true,"console":"false","complete":"true","x":846,"y":273,"wires":[]},{"id":"f65e9c4e.e7afb","type":"debug","z":"5e92f737.c60d68","name":"Log","active":true,"console":"false","complete":"true","x":846,"y":333,"wires":[]},{"id":"b3f32ebe.8a2ee","type":"inject","z":"5e92f737.c60d68","name":"Payload","topic":"","payload":"DocumentTest.txt","payloadType":"str","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"x":436,"y":333,"wires":[["e6748f3.2163b7"]]},{"id":"b0dbc35f.28665","type":"Save Blob","z":"5e92f737.c60d68","name":"Azure Save Blob Storage","x":646,"y":274,"wires":[["fdab4f1f.0cab"]]},{"id":"e6748f3.2163b7","type":"Get Blob","z":"5e92f737.c60d68","name":"Azure Get Blob Storage","x":647,"y":333,"wires":[["f65e9c4e.e7afb"]]}]
    ```
4. Double-click the Save Payload node

6. Double-click the Azure Save Blob Storage node, enter your Storage Account Name, Storage Account Key and your desired Container Name and Blob Name. Now click Done.

    If you leave the Storage Blob name blank, the text in the msg.payload will be used as your blob name. Eg. if your msg.payload is ```blob1.txt```, and the Storage Blob Name property is empty, the blob name will be assigned as ```blob1```
